Colorization
============

Colorization using Optimization

Colorization is a process of making black-and-white images colorful. A novel method for colorization [http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~yweiss/Colorization/colorization-siggraph04.pdf](Levin, Lischinski & Weiss, 2004) has been proposed that uses the simple idea that neighboring pixels in space-time have similar intensities.  Although the authors provide a MATLAB implementation of their method, we all love Python! Thus, our project aims to write these code in Python.
